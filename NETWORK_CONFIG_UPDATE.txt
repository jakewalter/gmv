                    NETWORK CONFIGURATION UPDATE
================================================================================

Date: November 3, 2025

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
==================

Both batch processing scripts have been updated to include comprehensive network
and channel coverage for maximum data availability:

NETWORKS ADDED
==============

Global M7.5+ Script (gmv_batch_m8_catalog.py):
  - All global networks including:
    * OK: Oklahoma USGS network
    * US: United States Geological Survey
    * Y7, Y9: USArray Transportable Array stations
    * ZP: PBO Seismic Network
    * O2: Ocean Bottom seismic network
    * TA, IU: Temporary and Global networks
    * And all other available networks

Local Oklahoma M4.5+ Script (gmv_batch_ok_local.py):
  - OK: Oklahoma USGS network
  - US: United States Geological Survey
  - N4: Network for Earthquake Engineering
  - XO: Other experimental networks
  - O2: Ocean Bottom seismic network
  - Y7: USArray Transportable Array
  - Y9: USArray Transportable Array
  - ZP: PBO Seismic Network
  - TA: Temporary Arrays
  - IU: Global Seismic Network

CHANNELS EXPANDED
=================

Both scripts now include BOTH broadband AND non-broadband stations:

Broadband Channels:
  - LH*: Long-period high gain seismometers (0.1-1 Hz)
  - BH*: Broad-band high gain seismometers (0.1-10 Hz)
  - HH*: High-frequency seismometers (0.1-100 Hz)

Non-Broadband Channels:
  - EH*: Extremely short-period high gain seismometers
  - SH*: Short-period high gain seismometers

COMMAND-LINE PARAMETERS
=======================

Global M7.5+ Earthquakes:
  -n all              Use all networks globally
  -b LH,BH,HH,EH,SH   Include all channel bands

Local Oklahoma M4.5+ Earthquakes:
  -n OK,US,N4,XO,O2,Y7,Y9,ZP,TA,IU   Use expanded Oklahoma networks
  -b LH,BH,HH,EH,SH                   Include all channel bands

IMPACT
======

These changes will:
1. Increase the number of available seismic stations per event
2. Include shorter-period (higher frequency) data (EH*, SH* channels)
3. Provide more complete spatial coverage
4. Enable better phase picking with diverse station types
5. Enhance ground motion visualization quality

REFERENCE STATION
=================

Both scripts maintain SMO (Oklahoma City seismic station) as the reference
station for consistent phase picking and visualization.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
=======================

These are non-breaking changes:
- Existing scripts continue to work unchanged
- Output filenames remain the same
- Processing parameters are compatible with gmv_generalized.py
- Enhanced data selection improves visualization quality
